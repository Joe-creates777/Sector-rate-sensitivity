# Reports

This directory contains **analysis outputs** generated from the sector rate sensitivity study.

The contents here are meant to summarize results rather than raw computation steps.  
Typical artifacts include:
- Key figures illustrating sector-level sensitivity to interest rate changes
- Tables reporting regression coefficients or summary statistics
- Intermediate results used to support conclusions presented in the README

Subdirectories:
- `figures/` — Visualization outputs (plots, charts)
- `tables/` — Tabular results and numerical summaries

These outputs are designed for **interpretation and communication**, especially for readers who want to quickly understand the empirical findings without diving into the full codebase.
