# Scripts

This directory contains lightweight analysis scripts related to the sector interest rate sensitivity study.

The scripts here are **not intended to form a fully automated production pipeline**, but rather to document the core analytical steps in a clear and reproducible way.

Typical responsibilities of scripts in this folder include:
- Fetching or loading macroeconomic and market data
- Computing interest rate changes and sector-level returns
- Running regression or sensitivity analyses
- Generating summary statistics used in the main analysis

The primary goal is **clarity and transparency**, allowing readers to understand how the results are produced without over-engineering the workflow.

For exploratory work and detailed experimentation, see the notebooks and analysis code referenced in the main README.
